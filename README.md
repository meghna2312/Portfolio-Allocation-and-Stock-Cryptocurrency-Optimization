The objective of this project is to use Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to create a portfolio of stocks that maximizes profit return, while accouting for risk and volatility. This project has the following components:

-Exploratory Data Analysis that explores the risk and volatility of our stocks and cryptocurrencies

-Non Linear Optimzation Model for Portfolio Allocation

-Monte Carle Simulation to compute the probability with which our selected portfolio will lose money

-Analysis on how our portfolio performed
